# Python-Basics-Automation
This repository is geared towards sharing my knowledge of Python. For most of the content I'll be using the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart. My goal for this repository is to help others learn Python basics and answer questions they might have. Keep in mind, I am a beginner. Make no mistake about it, I have very little Python experience (at the time of creation). This repository serves as a collection of notes and experiences that I'm documenting on my journey towards become more familiar with Python. My hope is that you are able to take away simply the very basics of python and basic automation. Thanks for visiting the repo. Enjoy!

# The Outline
The chapters listed below are that directly from the book. However, I will be spending more time on some topics than pther in order to:
1) Amplify the basics for both my understanding and introductory users
2) Make sure I do not plagiarize 
3) Give my own personal spin on topics
4) Form my own notes in a way that makes sense to me based off what I learned
