# Python Basics, Basic Automation, Introduction to VSCode and Git
<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository is geared towards sharing my knowledge of Python. For most of the content I'll be using the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart (You can find the contents here: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). My goal for this repository is to help others learn Python basics and answer questions they might have. Keep in mind, I am a beginner. Make no mistake about it, I have very little Python experience (at the time of creation). This repository serves as a collection of notes and experiences that I'm archiving during my journey towards becoming more familiar with Python. My hope is that you are able to take away the very basics of python and basic automation. Thanks for visiting the repo. <br />

Additionally, I'll be covering what software I'll be using to edit the Python coding projects and how to set up your IDE. There's a plethora of information out there that will show how to set up the tools I'll be using, I'm going to document what has worked for me. If you have an easier way or a more efficient opnionin, feel free to notify me! I'm very open to learning and using new tools to expand my knowledge. <br />

# IDE
I will be using Microsoft Virtual Studio Code and GitBash. I'm also a beginner when it comes to working with VSCode and Git/GitBash so you'll see a lot of Git related notes here too. If you plan on using VSCode and Git then you'll be pleased to know I'll be adding notes to the repo on the basics of using VSCode and Git. 

# The Outline
The chapters listed below are that directly from the book. However, I will be spending more time on some topics than others in order to:
1) Amplify the basics for both my understanding and introductory users
2) Make sure I do not plagiarize 
3) Give my own personal spin on topics
4) Form my own notes in a way that makes sense to me based off what I learned
