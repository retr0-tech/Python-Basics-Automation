# Using Git with VSCode
In order to generate SSH keys and to use git in a higher capacity, I have ordere gitbash or Git for windows. You can find the program here: https://gitforwindows.org/.
Git for Windows provides a BASH emulation used to run Git from the command line. *NIX users should feel right at home, as the BASH emulation behaves just like the "git" command in LINUX and UNIX environments. I'm sure there's other ways to do the exact same thing but, this is how I've learned to do it. <br />

You can find a very descriptive tutorial on how to install GitBash here: https://www.toolsqa.com/git/install-git-on-windows/.

5.	You will then be prompted to add the URL; copy, and paste the URL when prompted <br />
6.	Save the file to your desired location (I have a folder dedicated to coding projects and information <br />

8.	You will then see your repo! <br />
