# Welcome to Python!
The link to the official Python website is here: https://www.python.org. They have beginner guides located here: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers. Feel free to go straight to the website! On their website they also have documentation for installation, places to go to pracice, and other courses related to python. I'll cover a lot of the information here as well. Remember, definitions can be found in the 'Terminology' file. <br />

# What is Python?
Python is a programming language. The Python interpreter software reads source code and performs its instructions. Fun fact, Python actually gets it's from the British comedy group Monty Python.Before we continue lets take a look at what is happening when we interpret our Python code programs. This is what the data execution flow looks like: <br />

Source Code --(preprocessing)--> Intermediate Code --(Processing)--> Interpreter <br />

# Source Code
Source course is any collection of code written in human-readable. Source code is translated by a compiler, interpreter, or assembler into object code before execution. If you think about it, source code is how we use human language (and sometimes Pokemon language: http://trove42.com/introducing-pikachu-programming-language/) to interact with computers and their respective hardware. <br />

# Intermediate Code
Intermediate code is used to translate source code into machine code, or computer-readable code. Intermediate code sits in between high-level language and machine language. <br />

# An intepre-what?
An interpreter is a computer program that is used to directly execute program instructions written using one of the many high-level programming languages. An interpreter takes high-level programming into an intermediate language that it then executes. It does so by translating one program at a time. This takes less amount of time for code analysis and debugging however, it makes the who program slower as far as execution time is concerned. Interpreters are more memory efficient because no intermediate object code is generated. 
The data execution flow looks something like this: <br />

Source Code --(preprocessing)--> Intermediate Code --(Processing)--> Interpreter <br />

Now we, see what data execution flow is like for a program, let's look at what everything is at the base level.
